# Glowbuzzer React Generic Example

This example demonstrates a robot application using the Glowbuzzer React framework. The application has a single robot kinematics configuration using Stauble TX40 robot kinematics. It also shows how a graphical robot model can be added to the tool path display. 

To run this example:

1. Copy `config/config.json` to the working directory where you will run GBC
2. Run GBC. Check in the startup log that `config.json` was loaded (not `default.json`)
3. Start the React app using `nx serve staubli`
4. Open the app in your browser
