# Glowbuzzer React Generic Example

This example demonstrates a generic application using the Glowbuzzer React framework. The application has two independent kinematics configurations: a simple 3-axis cartesian configuration and a single-axis auxilliary configuration.

To run this example:

1. Copy `config/config.json` to the working directory where you will run GBC
2. Run GBC. Check in the startup log that `config.json` was loaded (not `default.json`)
3. Start the React app using `nx serve generic`
4. Open the app in your browser
