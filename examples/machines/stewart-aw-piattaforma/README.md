# Glowbuzzer Stewart Platform Example

This example is an implementation of Stewart platform kinematics for the AutomationWare Piattaforma.

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ezHaKbUmM for a video of the platform in action, but note that using the glowbuzzer
framework, full control of the platform is possible including translation in xyz and rotation.

If you haven't run one of our examples before, you will need to download and ensure you can run GBC. 
See https://glowbuzzer.com/get-started/simulation for details.

To run this example:

1. Run GBC
1. Start the React app using `vite examples/stewart-aw-piattaforma`
1. Open the app in your browser
1. Connect to GBC
1. Push the config and enable operation
1. Use the cartesian jog panel to move the platform around
