    <h2><i>Our vision is to make it easy to use web development technologies to build machine controls free of a dependency on   proprietary hardware</i></h2>
</Card>


## Is this a really new idea?
The idea of using modern software development tech to develop machine controls isn’t new:  every PLC and robot control will have been developed in C/C++ which was the new tech many decades ago.
Beckhoff’s TwinCAT vision, formed 20 years ago, of using blending Codesys with Microsoft development tools contains definite echoes of what we are doing. TwinCAT is looking very old now against the explosion of web tech and “Windows C++ development” is now classed as a legacy technology in the software industry.

We admire Beckhoff and our aim is to be ‘the Beckhoff of the web era’.

What is new in the glowbuzzer toolkit is the deep embracing of web technology to deliver a platform for building machine controls of a industrially deployable nature.

But do not confuse this with the vendors starting to offer web-based HMI development approaches. These do not have web technology running all the way through them. They are a thin layer of web technology spread over the top of legacy technologies to give them a modern feel - e.g. Siemens TIA.  Yes, you can write your front-end in JavaScirpt but you will still be grappling with legacy technology and fighting them all the way. Glowbuzzer has an end-to-end web tech archictecture.

Yes you can “build your HMI in HTML5 running off a tradition PLC”  but this is a token gesture. There are a myriad of HMI development frameworks available from mainstream vendors and third-parties that combine developing with HTML 5 and OPC UA for communication to provide a way of developing front-end machine control applications in web-tech. In these cases, the actual logic of the control program is still written in the PLC, variables to display and take input from the HMI are surfaced with HTML5. This is totally different to the glowbuzzer toolkit where the whole machine control application is developed in web tech.
