# glowbuzzer values

Two things excite glowbuzzer people:

* working with modern software development tools and techniques
* making machines do interesting and useful things

This needs an interesting blend of people with different skills and outlooks:
* software developers intesrted in things like teh latest web tech and real-time OS frameworks
* automation professionals - interested in drives and machines and happy to get their hands dirty

Machine control is a difficult problem to solve which is why it is an area neglected by the the massive changes in the software dev

Professionalism. its got to work. needs rigour

If you like modern software development and what to make machines do exciting things then you are also a glowbuzzer person.
