# EL2522

## Introduction

This short guide reviews the Beckhoff EL2522 terminal and discusses how to get them working with GBEM.

The EL2522 is a Beckhoff io terminal that performs incremental encoder simulation. This means it outputs a frequency modulated signal (for example step/direction) that can be used to control motor drivers. Each terminal can support outputs. The outputs can be step/direction or an encoder simulation signal.

The EL2522 supports an enhanced operating mode which allows continuous positioning with output pulses that cycle-synchronously. This means we can cyclically write a position to the device and it will output pulses to reflect that position updating its internal counter to reflect position.

This terminal is useful, if for example, we have a driver for a motor that supports step/direction that we want to use with our control.

The output stage allows a maximum frequency of 500 kHz to be output. 500KHz when used with a 200 steps / rev  motor = 2500 rps = 150k rpm. 500LHz when used with a 200 steps / rev motor and the drive is using 128 microstepping = 20 rps = 1200 rpm. So the 500KHz is sufficient for most usage scenarios.

## Testing

## Oscilloscope

We connected the A+ output of the EL2522's first channel to an oscilloscope. A- (the complimentary output) is left disconnected. The B+ and B- outputs just signal the direction and these were also left disconnected.

First at constant velocity:

This is exactly what we would expect. A steady stream of pulses at a frequency that corresponds to our maximum velocity.

Secondly during an acceleration ramp:

Again this is what we would expect. There slight discontinuities in the increase in frequency at around 170ms probably caused by the cyclic setting of position and Beckhoff's algorithm for calculating the frequency for the next period but we wouldn't expect this to be audibly noticeable on the motor but these could cause slight path variation if the drive was used for precision synchronised motion.
