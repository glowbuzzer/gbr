# EL7041

## Introduction

This short guide reviews the Beckhoff EL7037 drive and discusses how to get them working with GBEM.

## Product features

The EL7031 is an updated version of the venerable EL7031 stepper motor terminal.

It supports a fixed 24V motor supply voltage and has 1.5A maximum current.

It works with both generic unipolar and bipolar stepper motors and Beckhoff AS10xx and AS20xx motors.

The drive will work with motors either with/without an encoder using an internal counter in the latter case. The encoder needs to be the Beckhoff standard 24V signalling with single-ended A B C connections.

When connected to a Beckhoff motor the drive supports vector control. 

Vector control (a.k.a Field-orientated control) is a "modern" (1970s) technique for controlling motors. This is about the best guide we found for understanding the technical details, https://www.switchcraft.org/learning/2016/12/16/vector-control-for-dummies. In the context of driving small stepper motors the advantages of vector control are:

* the current is adjusted based on the load (pretty handy) 
* less resonance

The drive is 64 micro-stepping which is permanently fixed.

It is suggested by Beckhoff to use a brake chopper terminal (EL9576) and/or PSU buffer capacitor terminal (EL9570) for short deceleration ramps though with small motors we have not found any discernible difference. At some point we will do some tests with larger motors.

## Extended mode

The terminal supports extended control modes. 

field orientated control

only for Beckhoff motors

current adjusted depending on load - very nice

Extended modes require a commutation determination cycle when the drive is enabled. This motor turns a few degrees CW and CCW which for some applications is a pain in the arse.

## Basics

## Our ratings for the EL7037

````shell
Ease of use :						★★★★☆ ()
