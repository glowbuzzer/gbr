# JointDro

Displays values of joints. By default will display all configured joints. If joints specify minimum and maximum values,
a gauge will be displayed showing the range of motion.

## Simple example

```jsx codeDemo
import * as React from "react";
import {JointDro} from "@glowbuzzer/controls";

export default () => <JointDro/>
```

## Selection of joints example

Use the `joints` parameter to specify which joints should be displayed.

```jsx codeDemo
import * as React from "react";
import {JointDro} from "@glowbuzzer/controls";

const joints_to_display={
    0: "A",
    4: "B",
    5: "C",
};

export default () => <JointDro joints={joints_to_display}/>
```
