# Rapidly build user interfaces with Glowbuzzer

Glowbuzzer provides a comprehensive framework and set of controls that help you get up and running quickly.

All code in the user interface framework is open source, so you can see how the example UIs are put together and adapt things to your needs.

The framework is built on other open source projects, primarily React, Redux and Ant Design.
