# Motion in GBC

## Introduction

GBC can control

* Single joint motion control

* Multiple joints in master/slave

* Multiple joints in co-ordinated motion in 3D space



## Single joint motion control

The basic motion control of a single joint

move to a position

move at velocity



move superimpose

stop



## Multiuple joints in master slave



## Multiple joints in co-ordinated motion in 3D space



Move Line

Move Arc









## Activities that perform motion



For moves planned in cartesian space with cartesian space targets:

* `MoveArc`

* `MoveLine`

Moves planned in joint space with cartesian space target:

* `MoveToPosition`

Moves planning in joint space with joint space target
* `MoveJoints`
* `MoveJointsAtVelocity`
