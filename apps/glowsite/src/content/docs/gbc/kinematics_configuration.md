In GBC a kinematics configuration is a collection of joints that are controlled in concert to produce motion.

A six DOF robot has six joints (motors) these six joints are 

A three axis cartesian milling machine has 3 joints (XYZ) and these three joints are members of the kinematics configuration



Kinematics configurations need to have mathematical mode attached to them and the params for the chain
