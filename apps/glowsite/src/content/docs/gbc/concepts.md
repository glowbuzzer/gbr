# Concepts in GBC

GBC especially when used to control robots, requires a basic understanding of some common concepts widely used in machine control.

Discussion of these concepts and how they are implemented in GBC:

* Co-ordinate systems and frames - see [frames](frames.md)
* kinematics configurations - see [kinematics configurations](kinematics_configurations.md)
* tasks and activities - see [tasks and activities](task_and_activities.md)
* orientation - see (orientation)[orientation.md]
