# Motion - trajectory planning
A motion controller calculates the trajectories that the motors follow in order to meet the desired commands.

The trajectory is often composed as a sequence of positions over time; these tells the motor where to position itself and how fast it must do so.

These trajectories are sent to the drives which powers the motors.

At the heart of the glowbuzzer tool kit is our own innovative trajectory planner that computes time optimal and time synchronised multi-dimensional third-order trajectories complying maximal asymmetric motion limits on velocity, acceleration and jerk. This provides the core of our 3D-axis, synchronized axis and single-axis motion control capabilities.

The planner includes the following features:

The motion control includes a variety of kinematics modules to support different types of robot and machines (6 industrial robots, 5 axis industrial SCARA robots, delta, cartesian, hexpod etc.)
