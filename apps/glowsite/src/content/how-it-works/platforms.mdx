# What platforms does the glowbuzzer toolkit run on?

<Row align={"middle"}>
    <Col span={12}><h2>Front-end (FE)</h2>
        <p>The front-end is a set of react components. React components can run in web browsers or with React Native on
            Android/IoS or Windows/MacOs (or Electron).</p>
        <p>This means the front-end components can be deployed on a range of devices either in the browser or natively -
            Windows PCs, Macs, Tablets, Phones, different HMIs.</p>
        <h2>Core control (GBC)</h2>
        <p>The core control is written in vanilla c code and is written to be highly portable.</p>
        <p>The core supported platforms are real-time Linux & embedded STM32 but no issues are likely to be found
            deploying on platforms such as VxWorks, QNX, Xenomai or different high-end dual core (cortex M4/M7)
            microcontrollers running FreeRTOS.</p>
        <p>The core control is designed to be highly performant. For example, the Raspberry 4 single board computer
            supports 6 axis robots at a 1msec cycle time to the drives.</p>
        <p>If you are using the glowbuzzer toolkit with Linux (rather than running on an embedded microcontroller) you
            will need either an industrial PC or an embedded Linux platform.</p>
        <p>Industrial PCs come in two flavours:</p>
        <li>Traditional PC with for example a Mini ATX mother board and an Intel/AMD processor in an industrial
            enclosure
        </li>
        <li>(usually) an ARM based SoC delivered in either in a SBC (single board computer) format or SoM/CoM on a
            modules plugged or soldered onto a carrier board
        </li>
        <p>Embedded Linux are usually ARM SoC based platforms. In this area, we work with Toradex (www.toradex.com) but
            there are many other vendors or ??</p>
        <p>To use either option will require multiple Ethernet ports or Ethernet+WiFi. One Ethernet port will be devoted
            to EtherCAT traffic and the other to communicating over websockets to the React front-end software.</p>
        <p>GBC runs on low-end hardware but needs multiple cores. The lowest specification we would recommend would be a
            quad-core running at 1+ GHz and having 1+ GB of RAM.</p>

## Drive and IO interfacing (GBEM/GBSM)

GBEM and GBSM run on Linux or on a microcontoller.

Interfaces with GBC over shared memory on Linux or through SPI on embedded platforms.
