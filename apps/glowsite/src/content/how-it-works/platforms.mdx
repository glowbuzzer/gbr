# What platforms does the glowbuzzer toolkit run on?



## Front-end (FE)

The front-end is a set of react components. React components can run in web browsers or with React Native on Android/IoS or Windows/MacOs (or Electron).

This means the front-end components can be deployed on a range of devices either in the browser or natively - Windows PCs, Macs, Tablets, Phones, different HMIs.

## Core control (GBC)
The core control is written in vanilla c code and is written to be highly portable.

The core supported platforms are real-time Linux & embedded STM32 but not issues are likely to be found deploying on platforms such as VxWorks, QNX, Xenomai or different high-end dual core (cortex M4/M7) microcontrollers running FreeRTOS.

The core control is designed to be highly performant. For example, the Raspberry 4 single board computer supports 6 axis robots at a 1msec cycle time to the drives.

If you are using the glowbuzzer toolkit with Linux (rather than running on an embedded microcontroller) you will need either an industrial PC or an embedded Linux platform.

Industrial PCs come in two flavours:

* Traditional PC with for example a Mini ATX mother board and an Intel/AMD processor in an industrial enclosure
* (usually) an ARM based SoC delivered in either in a SBC (single board computer) format or SoM/CoM on a modules plugged or soldered onto a carrier board

Embedded Linux are usually ARM SoC based platforms. In this area, we work with Toradex (www.toradex.com) but there are many vendors or

To use either option will require multiple Ethernet ports or Ethernet+WiFi. One Ethernet port will be devoted to EtherCAT traffic and the other to communicating over websockets to the React front-end software.

GBC runs on low-end hardware but needs multiple cores. The lowest specification we would recommend would be a quad-core running at 1+ GHz and having 1+ GB of RAM.

## Drive and IO interfacing (GBEM/GBSM)

GBEM and GBSM run on Linux or on a microcontoller.

Interfaces with GBC over shared memory on Linux or through SPI on embedded platforms.
