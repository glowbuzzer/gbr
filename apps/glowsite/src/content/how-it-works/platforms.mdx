# What platforms does the glowbuzzer toolkit run on?

## Core control (GBC)
The core control is written in vanilla c code and is written to be highly portable.

The core supported platforms are real-time Linux & embedded STM32 but not issues are likely to be found deploying on platforms such as VxWorks, QNX, Xenomai or different high-end dual core (cortex M4/M7) microcontrollers running FreeRTOS.

The core control is designed to be highly performant. For example, the Raspberry 4 single board computer supports 6 axis robots at a 1msec cycle time to the drives.

If you are using the glowbuzzer toolkit with Linux (rather than running on an embedded microcontroller) you will need either an industrial PC or an embedded Linux platform.

Industrial PCs come in two flavours:

* Traditional PC with for example a Mini ATX mother board and an Intel/AMD processor in an industrial enclosure
* (usually) an ARM based SoC delivered in either in a SBC (single board computer) format or SoM/CoM on a modules plugged or soldered onto a carrier board

Embedded Linux are usually ARM SoC based platforms. In this area we work with Toradex (www.toradex.com) but there are many vendors or

To use either option will require multiple Ethernet ports or Ethernet+WiFi.

GBC runs on low end hardware  but needs multiple cores. The lowest specification we would recommend would be a quad core running at 1+ GHz and having 1GB of ram.
