# Basically, how does it work?

The glowbuzzer toolkit allows you to build machine control applications using a web stack.

A *machine* is a collection of motors controlled via drives together with IO for interacting with the sensors and actuators that make up a machine.

At a high level, you take the glowbuzzer toolkit’s React components and use them either unchanged, extended or added to with your own custom components to build the visual front-end and control logic for your machine control.

This user interface and control logic code runs either in the browser or as a desktop application or on a mobile device.

Where a front-end component needs to make the machine perform an action (move or turn something on or off) it issues commands over a WebSocket interface. When a front-end component needs to interact with the state of the machine it reads from a WebSocket interface.

The WebSockets interface the fron-end reads and writes to is provided by the glowbuzzer toolkit’s real-time control software that runs either on Linux or on an embedded microcontroller.

It is this software’s responsibility to translate the high-level instructions received over the WebSockets interface into the low-level commands that can issued over the fieldbus to control io and drives to make the machine move and perform actions. This is where the “heavy lifting” takes place: synchronised multi-axis trajectories are planned, kinematics functions are run, tasks and activities are executed and the state of the machine is calculated. These functions run in real-time.

At is simplest, a browser running your React machine control application is talking WebSockets over the network to the real-time control and EtherCAT master running on a Linux platform which is connected to a fieldbus (containing drives and IO) or to embedded drives and IO.

This gives you the ability to build a sophisticated control for complex machines and robots using a modern web and open software stack with *absolutely no proprietary hardware required*.

Insert great video showing:
* Someone typing “npm I glowbuzzer” and the toolkit installing
* Then show them plugging in a linux board to some drives
* Then show them writing some code to move a motor in IDE in web stack land
* Show the front-end browser say clicking a button to start the motor moving
* Then show a video of a motor moving - oscillating move
