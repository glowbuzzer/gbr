# What drives does it work with?

## EtherCAT
If you are using glowbuzzer toolkit with an EtherCAT fieldbus, we can support any stepper or BLDC or servo drive that offers a CiA-402 drive profile and cyclic-synchronous-position mode (CSP) â€“ this is almost every EtherCAT drive on the market.

This means you can control motors ranging from tiny 4mm diameter 50,000 rpm BLDC devices through to multi-megawatt motors the size of trucks.

Drives that have been pre-integrated and tested include:

* Oriental Motor - AZD series
* Omron - G5 series
* Beckhoff - EL7031, EL7041, EL7037, EL7046, EL7211, EL2522, AX500
* Kollmorgen - AKD series
* Delta - ASDA series
* JVL - MIS series
* Cannon automata - SMC3
* Nanotec - N5
* Trinamic - ?

See [EtherCAT pre-configured drive overview](/docs/gbem/drive_support_overview) for a full list of the pre-configured drives.


## Embedded stepper / servo / BLDC

If you are embedding a machine control, fieldbus based drives may not be suitable. For example, if your application is a control for a machine containing 3 or 4 stepper motors and a small set of digital and analog IO, you may well want to embed the drives into yoru control electronics.

Part of the glowbuzzer toolkit is GBSM which is a software application for use on Linux (usually embedded Linux) or microcontoller platforms. This works with motor drive ICs to control stepper / BDLC or servo motors in an embedded environment.
