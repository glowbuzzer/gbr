# Front-end components
## React components
The glowbuzzer tookit ships with many front-end React components. You will probably use some of these components unmodified (e.g., the component to connect to a machine) while others can be the starting point for you to modify to your specific needs.



We have selected a handful of the components here to give you a flavour of what's available. But see: <Link to="/docs/ui/getting_started">User interface Documentation</Link> to see the full suite of components.

* **Machine connection and state machine** - connecting to the machine or robot and taking it through its start-up state machine viewing any errors that may occur
* **Jogging** - manually moving the machine or robot either in cartesian or joint space
* **DRO** - where is the machine, in joint-space, in cartesian space in different frames
* **Task/activities** - interaction with the control programs (tasks and activities)
* **Analogue and digital in/out** - see that state of inputs and set the state of outputs on the machine
* **g-code** - load and send gcode to the machine
* **Path view** - shows in a 3D view where the machine is and the path the program will take the TCP on
* **Robot/machine view** - for machines with non-trivial kinematics (robots) shows a 3d view of the machine
* **Telemetry** - shows the trajectories that are sent to drives (for diagnostic purposes)

<Tabs defaultActiveKey="1" >
    <TabPane tab="Machine connection" key="1">
        The machine connection
    </TabPane>
    <TabPane tab="Joint DRO" key="2">
        Content of Tab Pane 2
    </TabPane>
    <TabPane tab="Bit Field Display" key="3">
        The bitfield display is used
    </TabPane>
</Tabs>



You will import the controls you need into your project:

````tsx
import {
    CartesianDro,
    ConnectTile,
    DigitalInputsTile,
    DigitalOutputsTile,
    FeedRateTile,
    GCodeTile,
    JogTile,
    ToolPathTile
} from "@glowbuzzer/controls"

## HMI options

### React on mobile
Front-ends built with the glowbuzzer toolkit are web applications and any device running a modern browser that uses the V8 engine (Chrome, and Chromium based browsers e.g., Microsoft Edge, Opera etc.) can happily display the applications. This includes many HMI panels available.

However, sometimes you need your application to run as a proper application on the mobile device (phone/tablet running Android or IoS). Most of the time you interact with an app on your phone or tablet (banking, facebook etc.) it is with an app actually running on the device, not through the browser, as it gives the developers the mechanisms to build a much better user experience.

You can use React Native to develop both Android and iOS apps. This means, you don’t have to use Android Studio with Java/Kotlin or Xcode with Swift. Instead, you can use your usual IDE and use JavaScript/TypeScript. (You just need the google/apple IDEs to upload the finished application to the stores).

Distribution. Obviously for end customers, a public app store is best. For example, with Apple you need to register for the iOS Developer license which costs $99 per year and enables you to publish apps to the public store. Apple also have their B2B Apps Program for $299 per year which allows for apps that are not available on the public app store and your customer use a coupon to install the app. There are various other mechanisms to distribute apps for testing purposes outside of the store (e.g. TestFlight). Similar arrangements exist with google and the Play store.

You can have a shared codebase between Android and iOS apps. Huge number of libraries. Don’t need to develop on a Mac for iOS.

Downsides: slightly less performance especially for data-heavy apps. But it’s good enough for most of Facebook though!

### Android on embedded
Can run android on non-phone devices e.g. HMIs

Industrial Android, as the name suggests, is a great option for customers looking to introduce innovation to their factories, plants and devices through user-friendly, familiar-looking HMIs.

Android is not only the most popular OS for mobile devices today, but also broadly deployed in different industrial use cases. It provides a great user interface and a stack of reusable software components, simplifying development and maintaining millions of existing applications and libraries.

additional features which are not available on the stock Android like full kiosk mode, extended connectivity with device management and integrated FOTA support.
