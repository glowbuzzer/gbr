# Real-time communication

A question you must be asking yourself is "How can a React app running in the browser or on a desktop handle the 1ms responses times needed by industrial control applications?

The simple answer is that it can’t but we solve this problem through our clever architecture.

Standard Windows/Mac desktops running a react application are subject to the Garbage Collection (GC) regime and the “moments” desktop PCs have which means your React control application can’t always respond to events occurring on the machine in real-time.

We get around this limitation through supporting code being deployed into 4 tiers with differing response times.

You need to architect your application carefully based on the response time needed to make sure the code runs in the right tier - usually 99% of the code lives in Tier1 and just some small specialised functions live in the other tiers.

* Tier 1 - the react application - response time between 10 milliseconds & 1 second (usually it is very quick because desktop PCs are speedy and networks are fast but occasionally the response time is slower)
* Tier 2 - JavaScript code running inside GBC - response time around 5 milliseconds
* Tier 3 - C code hooked into GBC - response time guaranteed to be your cycle time (4 milliseconds down to 0.5 milliseconds)
* Tier 4 - C code running in GBEM (EtherCAT master) or GBSM (Step master) - response time guaranteed to be your cycle time (4 milliseconds down to 0.5 milliseconds)

Privileged functions like estop live down in Tiers 3 and 4 whereas the function to enable the machine for initial use lives in Tier 1.
