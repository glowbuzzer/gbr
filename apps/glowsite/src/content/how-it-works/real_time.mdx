# Real-time communication

A question you must be asking yourself is "How can a React app running in the browser or on a desktop handle the 1ms responses times needed by industrial control applications?

The simple answer is that it can’t but we solve this problem through our clever architecture.

Standard Windows/Mac desktops running a react application are subject to the Garbage Collection (GC) regime and the “moments” desktop PCs have which means your React control application can’t always respond to events occurring on the machine in real-time.

We get around this limitation through supporting code being deployed into 4 tiers with differing response times.



<Row>
    <Col span="20" style={{background: '#722ed7', color: '#ffff', padding: '10px 10px'}}> Tier 1 - React application - response time between 10 milliseconds & 1 second (usually fast as PCs are generally very quick but this is not guaranteed)</Col>
</Row>
<Row>
    <Col span="20" style={{background: '#9254de', color: '#ffff', padding: '10px 10px'}}> Tier 2 - Javascript code runnin, inside the real-time control (GBC) - response time around 5 milliseconds</Col>
</Row>
<Row>
    <Col span="20" style={{background: '#b37feb', color: '#ffff', padding: '10px 10px'}}> Tier 3 - C code hooked into the real-tiem control (GBC) - response time guaranteed to be your cycle time (4 milliseconds down to 0.5 milliseconds)</Col>
</Row>
<Row>
    <Col span="20" style={{background: '#d3adf7', color: '#ffff', padding: '10px 10px'}}> Tier 4 - C code running in GBEM (EtherCAT master) or GBSM (Step master) - response time guaranteed to be your cycle time (4 milliseconds down to 0.5 milliseconds)</Col>
</Row>


You need to architect your application carefully based on the response time needed to make sure the code runs in the right tier - usually 99% of the code lives in Tier1 and just some small specialised functions live in the other tiers.

Privileged functions like estop live down in Tiers 3 and 4 whereas the function to enable the machine for initial use lives in Tier 1.
