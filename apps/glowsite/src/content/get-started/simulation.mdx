# Simulation mode

Simulation is a way to test the glowbuzzer toolkit without needing any hardware.

It is also used to speed up the development of front-end components by allowing you to develop front-end machine control applications without having to fire-up specific hardware (drives, IO, fieldbusses etc.).

Testing the glowbuzzer toolkit in simulation mode means you can exercise a large part of the software from a Windows PC running WSL or a normal Linux PC. No Linux real-time extensions are required.

There are two steps to get started in simulation mode:

1. Download & run the front-end components
1. Download & run GBC (the core control)
