# What hardware do I need to get started?

## Introduction
To get started with the glowbuzzer toolkit, you need some hardware.

The easiest route to getting started is using a Linux single board computer on which the core control and EtherCAT master run. This board is connected to EtherCAT drive(s) and IO.

You will then develop the control application using react on your PC (Windows, Mac, Linux) and the front-end will be accessed through a browser.

Finally, you will need an EtherCAT servo or stepper drive and some EtherCAT IO - you need something to move and some IO to test.

You can provide your own hardware to get started or we have packages available to order of all the items, cables, power supplier etc. you need.

If you use identical hardware to our suggestion then following the tutorials is straight forward, if you use your own hardware then there will be additional configuration steps.


## Starter packages

We offer 3 starter packages:
1. **single axis starter package** - Oriental Motor AZD drive and absolute encoder motor with drive based IO using Raspberry Pi 4 platform - â‚¬800
1. **three axis Oriental Motor**
1. **embedded Linux starter** - Toradex imx8plus
