# What hardware do I need to get started?

## Introduction
You don't need any hardware to test the glowbuzzer toolkit in *simulation mode*. Everything can be run under WSL on a Windows PC or on Linux and no drives or IO is needed.

This will allow you to test out the front-end React components and see how GBC behaves and test out writing your own React components to control machines.

But really, the the glowbuzzer toolkit is all about making things move and for that you need some hardware. Something to run the toolkit on and some motors and IO to test your control program with.

In terms of the platform to run the toolkit on, the easiest route to getting started is using a Linux single board computer on which the core control and EtherCAT master run. This board is then connected to EtherCAT drive(s) and IO.

You will then develop the control application using react on your PC (Windows, Mac, Linux) and the front-end will be accessed through a browser.

Finally, you will need an EtherCAT servo or stepper drive and some EtherCAT IO - you need something to move and some IO to test.

You can provide your own hardware to get started or we have packages available to order of all the items, cables, power supplier etc. you need. All the components are common off the shelf.

If you use identical hardware to our suggestion then following the tutorials is straight forward, if you use your own hardware then there will be additional configuration steps.


## Starter packages

We offer 3 starter packages:
1. **single axis starter package** - Oriental Motor AZD drive and absolute encoder motor with drive based IO using Raspberry Pi 4 platform - â‚¬800
1. **three axis Oriental Motor**
1. **embedded Linux starter** - Toradex imx8plus
