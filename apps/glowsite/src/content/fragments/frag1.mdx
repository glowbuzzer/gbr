# The glowbuzzer toolkit
The glowbuzzer toolkit allows you to build machine control applications using a web stack (Node.js & React).

The low-level real-time control software runs on Linux (including on embeddable CPUs like the ARM Cortex-A-series) or on high-end multi-core microcontrollers and exposes a WebSocket interface to the high-level control running as a web application on the network or a shrink-wrapped application using React Native.

The low-level control integrates with EtherCAT and other industrial fieldbusses to communicate with drives, actuators and IO or with motor drive ICs in an embedded application.

The glowbuzzer toolkit enables you to build sophisticated control applications for machines and robots using a modern open software stack *with absolutely no proprietary hardware required*.
